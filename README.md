# face-emotion-recognition
This is an experiment on facial expression recognition using convolutional neural networks.

fer2013 and ferplus data sets are adopted in the three experiments. The data in fer2013 is more chaotic, with some mismarked data, animation pictures and other data, which interferes with the training of the model. However, the data in ferplus is updated, which shows that the accuracy of the third experiment is much improved, which indicates the importance of data preprocessing. Of course, the third one uses the Adam optimizer and some callback functions, which also has a great help to improve the accuracy.
